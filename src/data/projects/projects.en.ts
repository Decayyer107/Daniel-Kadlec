        description: "Zahrada smutku is a funeral service based in my hometown. I was assigned to design and develop this website during my one-month internship at Technické služby města Most, the municipal company responsible for managing local websites. The main goal was to create a clear, modern, and respectful website that would stand out from other outdated municipal service pages. My focus was on simplicity and accessibility - providing only essential information without unnecessary clutter, ensuring that visitors could easily find what they need during a difficult time. After completing the design and full development, I handed over the project to Technické služby města Most, who now maintain and update the website. This means that I no longer have direct control over its content or future changes.",

        technical_description: "I was originally assigned to create the entire website using a Bootstrap template to make future expansion easier. However, after several hours of planning and exploring how Bootstrap worked within the template, I realized that this approach wasn’t suitable for me. I had a clear vision of how I wanted the site to look and function, and I needed full control over every detail. In the end, I used only a small number of basic components and a few subtle animations from Bootstrap, but most of the code was written manually from scratch. This allowed me to shape the website exactly according to my vision and focus on a clean, well-structured, and technically solid result. The website is fully responsive and optimized for various devices and screen resolutions. This project pushed me out of my comfort zone, made me step away from modern frameworks, and return to pure HTML and CSS.",

I approached the project as an opportunity not only to improve an existing solution, but also to experiment with new approaches and design decisions.\n\n" +

            "The goal was to combine the bold, meaty character of a steakhouse with an elegant, premium dining experience. For this reason, I intentionally moved away from the original cool color palette toward warmer beige tones, which feel more inviting and better support a refined atmosphere.\n\n" +
            "The typography is based on a combination of a serif typeface for headings and a sans-serif typeface for longer texts. This pairing helps balance elegance with visual strength while maintaining good readability. I also added a subtle paper texture to the background to soften the overall look and give the website more character without becoming distracting. The entire redesign was created in Figma.",
